# Street Fighter LAN Edition

A multiplayer Street Fighter game with enhanced LAN networking capabilities.

## Enhanced Sprite System

The game now features a completely rewritten sprite loading system that provides:

### üé® **Automatic Sprite Loading**
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects and loads character sprites from the `images/` folder
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports both individual sprite files and sprite sheets
- **Fallback System**: Creates placeholder sprites if original files are missing
- **Portrait Generation**: Automatically creates character portraits from idle animations

### üéÆ **Supported Characters**
The enhanced system includes configurations for:
- Kunoichi (shadow clone, ninja vanish)
- Lightning Mage (lightning bolt, chain lightning)  
- Ninja_Monk (meditation, spirit punch)
- Ninja_Peasant (farm tools, humble strike)
- Samurai (katana slash, honor guard)
- Fire Wizard (fireball, flame jet)
- Wanderer Magician (magic arrow, arcane sphere)

### üîß **Smart Sprite Loading**
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Automatically scales sprites based on character configuration
- **Animation Mapping**: Maps sprite files to proper animations (idle, run, jump, attacks, etc.)
- **Special Skills**: Each character has unique special moves with proper animations
- **Performance Caching**: Loaded sprites are cached for better performance

### üé® **Fallback Features**
- **Missing Sprites**: Creates colored placeholder sprites for missing characters
- **Portrait Generation**: Generates character portraits from sprites or creates colorful placeholders
- **Background Loading**: Enhanced background loading with multiple format support

### üìÅ **File Structure Support**
The system handles various folder structures:
```
images/
  Character_Name/           # Individual sprite files
    Idle.png
    Run.png
    Attack_1.png
    ...
  Character_Name/Sprites/   # Organized in subfolder
    Idle.png
    Run.png
    ...
```

### üõ† **Testing Tools**
- **Sprite Test Utility**: Run `python test_sprites.py` to test sprite loading
- **Visual Inspector**: Interactive sprite viewer to check animations
- **Loading Diagnostics**: Detailed logging of sprite loading process

## Quick Start

### Windows Users
1. Double-click `start_game.bat` to launch the game launcher
2. Or run `python launcher.py` from command line

### Manual Start
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install pygame`
3. Run `python main.py` to start the main game

## Game Modes

### 1. Local Game (Recommended for beginners)
- Both players use the same computer
- Player 1: WASD + JKLUIO keys
- Player 2: Arrow keys + Numpad

### 2. LAN Multiplayer
- Both players must be on the same local network
- One player hosts, the other joins
- Automatic host discovery available

### 3. Manual IP Connection
- For when automatic discovery fails
- Enter the host's IP address manually

## Network Setup

### Requirements
- Both computers on the same local network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
- Port 12345 must be available (not blocked by firewall)
- Python 3.x with pygame installed on both computers

### Firewall Configuration
If connection fails, you may need to:

**Windows:**
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Click "Change Settings" then "Allow another app..."
4. Browse to your Python installation (usually `python.exe`)
5. Check both "Private" and "Public" networks
6. Click OK

**Alternative:** Temporarily disable firewall for testing

### Finding Your IP Address
The game launcher shows your IP address, or you can:
- Windows: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
- Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No games found on LAN"**
- Ensure both computers are on the same network
- Check firewall settings
- Try manual IP connection
- Use the network test utility

**"Connection failed"**
- Verify the IP address is correct
- Check if port 12345 is available
- Ensure host computer is actually hosting
- Try restarting both games

**"Port in use"**
- Close other instances of the game
- Restart the application
- Check if another program is using port 12345

**Game runs but controls don't work**
- Make sure the game window has focus
- Check if another program is capturing keyboard input
- Try restarting the game

### Network Testing
Use the launcher's "Test Network Connection" option or run:
```bash
python network_test.py
```

This will:
- Show your IP address
- Test port availability
- Scan for available games
- Test connections

### Performance Tips
- Close unnecessary programs to improve performance
- Ensure stable network connection
- Both players should have similar hardware specs for best experience
